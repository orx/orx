Orx - Portable Game Engine  (Version 1.2)

=============================================================================

orx 1.2
-----
* *** Added new platform with full support: iPhone (iPod Touch/iPad). ***
* *** Orx is now published under the zlib license, please see the LICENSE file. ***
* IMPORTANT: Added Unicode support with UTF-8. Config files now should be encoded with either plain ANSI or UTF-8: extended ASCII characters (ISO-Latin-1) won't be recognized any longer.
* IMPORTANT: Added custom bitmap font support in orx with Jørgen 'Jibs' Ibsen's Dina font as default.
* IMPORTANT: Added the orxFontGen tool to create orx-compatible bitmap fonts (.tga/.ini) from TrueType (.ttf) font files, using reference texts to define the list of characters to export.
* IMPORTANT: Joystick buttons/axes are now suffixed with the corresponding joystick's ID (JOY_X_1, JOY_1_2, ...).
* IMPORTANT: Added new plugins for embedded versions: SDL plugins for win/linux (35-40% than the SFML ones) and GLFW plugins for win/linux/osx (~2% faster than SDL ones).
* IMPORTANT: Added an OpenAL/libsndfile/stb_vorbis audio plugin as SFML audio plugin counterpart.
* IMPORTANT: SDL & GLFW now handle per-object shaders in a correct manner: shader is only applied when the object is rendered and only on it. This behavior can't be obtained with SFML plugins.
* IMPORTANT: Added an internal texture called "pixel" that holds a white pixel with full opacity. This can be used for all fade in/out effects and more.
* Added automatically generated coordinates for shader textures: Texture MyTex -> MyTex_Top, MyTex_Left, MyTex_Right & MyTex_Bottom are generated by orx in a consistant way across all platforms/plugins.
* GLFW plugins are now the default plugins for embedded mode. SFML plugins are still the only existing plugins for non-embedded mode.
* GLFW and SDL plugins also use SOIL library for handling graphic files I/O
* Fixed incorrectly names joystick axes
* Texts can use localized fonts using the locale module in the same way as string content
* Added orxBank_GetIndex() & orxBank_GetAtIndex() for array-like manipulations
* Heavy optims in the orxBANK module when allocating cells and clearing banks
* Added orxObject_BoxPick() for picking objects intersecting with box
* Added orxMOUSE_X and orxMOUSE_Y as valid inputs for the generic input system
* Added HSL/HSV color space support with HSL<->RGB & HSV<->RGB conversion functions
* Added ParentCamera property for cameras (useful for cascading cameras or Fixed/UI camera trick for portrait<->landscape adaptation)
* When selecting a new locale language at runtime, graphics containing localized text will now resize accordingly to the text's new size
* Added __orxFREEBASIC__ define for free basic friendly build of orx
* orxClock_RemoveTimer() can now filter using the registered context
* Added events orxCONFIG_EVENT_RELOAD_START, orxCONFIG_EVENT_RELOAD_END & orxCONFIG_EVENT_INVALID_TYPE_ACCESS
* Added some new orxConfig_* functions for advanced config manipulations
* Working directory is set to executable's one for all platforms (was done only for Mac OS X before)
* Fixed constness of all orxSTRING related code
* Cleaner texture/bitmap deletion handling
* Fixed FPS display position when aspect ratio is not 1:1
* Removed a couple of warnings from external library Box2D
* Fixed some minor issues in SFML-based sound plugin
* Config raw sections/values can now be accessed at runtime (used in EyeCreate's orx config editor Pey)
* Fixed sound attenuation ratio in SFML plugin
* Added Config::IgnorePath parameter to ignore all paths when loading resources (useful for iPhone bundles were all files easily end up in the root folder)
* Modules' Init & Exit functions are now optional (ie. stand alone application don't have to define them if not needed).
* Default minimal frequency for the home made renderer plugin is now 10Hz (was 60Hz).
* Fixed orxLOCALE_EVENT_SET_STRING not sent
* Some optims / fixes / cleaning

orx 1.1
-----
* Added orxCrypt command line tool for merging/encrypting/decrypting config files
* Added owner to spawner structure + all missing accessors for runtime handling
* Added associated clock to objects so as to allow localized time stretching (including sound pitch alteration)
* Clocks can now be created from config files and directly from objects. There can be only one clock with a given name (like cameras)
* IMPORTANT: Renamed spawner's WaveNumber property to WaveSize
* IMPORTANT: World gravity now use the physics dimension ratio -> update your config files accordingly
* orxCLOCK is now an orxSTRUCTURE
* Added timer handling functions in clock module
* Fixed aspect ratio correction when viewport was narrower than camera
* Added custom events for animations
* Integrated current Box2D version from its svn repository
* Added Raycast feature when physics is enabled (+wrappers in body & object modules)
* Dynamic objects can now have parents and get the cumulated result move from parents + physics simulation!
* Added a custom gravity as Body's property
* Physics simulation is back on main clock to provide a more robust game loop
* Fixed FixedRotation property to use Box2D feature instead of orx's hacked one
* Fixed orxVector_FromCartesianToSpherical() not getting the correct Rho when colinear to negative axes
* Added names of both involved parts in contact events
* Fixed orxFRAME child calculation when using anisotropic scale on parent
* Fixed home render plugin camera rotation when the camera has a parent object
* Removed AutoDelete property for spawners
* Added possibility for spawner to transmit or not parent's rotation & scale (by default it transmit them as before)
* Added orxObject_GetChild() / orxObject_GetSibling() for querying dependencies (for objects created through config's ChildList property only)
* Fixed config block value incorrectly saved by orxConfig_Save()
* Added the possibility to use empty config values either by using an empty line or a ;
* IMPORTANT: Due to the above change, block values must have the opening " on the same line as the key attribution: Key = "
* Config section inheritance can now easily be modified on-the-fly, at runtime (orxConfig_SetParent())
* Added 'screen' keyword for ShaderList properties
* Optimized shader lists processing when rendering objects & viewports
* Fixed tutorial #5 (viewport) jerkyness
* Sets default gravity to none in Box2D physics plugin
* Fixed use of AutoScroll/DepthScale with objects using bodies
* Changed tutorial #11 (spawner/shader) shader code
* Added orxDisplay_GetVideoModeCounter() / orxDisplay_GetVideoMode() / orxDisplay_SetVideoMode() & orxDisplay_IsVideoModeAvailable() (+SFML implementations)
* Renamed orxInput_GetBoundInputNumber() to orxInput_GetBoundInputCounter()
* Renamed orxStructure_GetNumber() to orxStructure_GetCounter()
* orxSystem module is now part of core (external library independent) and not a plugin anymore (+updated all configurations)
* When querying screen texture size, the latest display size will always be used
* Updated bounce demo to be able to change resolution on the fly (F1/F2) + ToggleFullScreen on F3
* Added orx_WinExecute() helper for console-less windows application
* Added __orxWII__ platform define for future work
* Added __orxIPHONE__ platform define for future work
* Misc updates & fixes

orx 1.0 final
-----
* Added fully featured localization module (orxLocale)
* orxTEXT that relies on the orxLocale module will now be automatically updated when changing language at runtime
* Updated screenshot module to work with config reloads
* Optimized some access to the config module
* Added acceleration parameter to FX curves (to controle their frequencies over time)
* Fixed flipped & tiled objects rendering
* Replaced all external uses of orxRGBA by orxCOLOR
* Events handlers are now expected to return orxSTATUS_SUCCESS so as to continue calling other handlers
* Added orxDisplay_SetFullScreen() and orxDisplay_IsFullScreen() functions + SFML implementation
* Improved some tutorials + added localization example in tutorial #10
* Misc minor updates in code & comments

orx 1.0rc1
-----
* Migrated all SFML plugins on all platforms to SFML 1.5: linux was using SFML 1.3, other platforms were using SFML 1.4
* Fixed the reload of config history: logic was broken and it could even crash
* Physics plugin now can handle negative scales (mirror effect)
* Fixed spawner not using scale when setting spawned object's relative speed
* Added orxLOG_CONSOLE(), orxLOG_FILE() and orxLOG_RAW() helpers
* Config section are not allowed anylonger to have leading or trailing spaces + trimmed all requests accordingly
* Fixed spawner wave timestamp not being correctly cleared when a spawner was reset
* Removed obsolete files
* Misc minor updates in comments/doc files

orx 1.0rc0
-----
* Initial release candidate for orx 1.0
