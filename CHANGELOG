* Added orxDisplay_GetVideoModeCounter() / orxDisplay_GetVideoMode() / orxDisplay_SetVideoMode() & orxDisplay_IsVideoModeAvailable() (+SFML implementations)
* Renamed orxInput_GetBoundInputNumber() to orxInput_GetBoundInputCounter()
* Renamed orxStructure_GetNumber() to orxStructure_GetCounter()
* orxSystem module is now part of core (external library independent) and not a plugin anymore (+updated all configurations)
* When querying screen texture size, the latest display size will always be used
* Updated bounce demo to be able to change resolution on the fly (F1/F2) + ToggleFullScreen on F3
* Added orx_WinExecute() helper for console-less windows application
* Added __orxWII__ platform define for future work

* Fixed spawner not using scale when setting spawned object's relative speed
* Added orxLOG_CONSOLE(), orxLOG_FILE() and orxLOG_RAW() helpers
