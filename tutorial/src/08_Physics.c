/* This is a basic C tutorial creating physical bodies and playing with physics and collisions.
 *
 * See previous tutorials for more info about the basic object creation, clock, animation, viewport, sound and FX handling.
 *
 * This tutorial shows how to add physical properties to objects and handle collisions.
 *
 * As you can see, the physical properties are completely data-driven. So creating an object
 * with physical properties (ie. with a body) or without is the exact same line of code.
 *
 * Objects can be linked to a body which can be static or dynamic.
 * Each body can be made of up to 8 parts.
 *
 * A body part is defined by
 * - its shape (currently box, sphere and mesh (ie. convex polygon) are the only available)
 * - information about the shape size (corners for the box, center and radius for the sphere, vertices for the mesh)
 *   if no size data is specified, the shape will try to fill the complete body (using the
 *   object size and scale)
 * - collision "self" flags that defines this part
 * - collision "check" mask that defines with which other parts this one will collide
 *   (two parts in the same body will never collide)
 * - a flag (Solid) specifying if this shaped should only give information about collisions
 *   or if it should impact on the body physics simulation (bouncing, etc...)
 * - various attributes such as restitution, friction, density, ...
 *
 * Here we create static solid walls around our screen. We then spawn boxes in the middle.
 * The number of boxes created is tweakable through the config file and is 100 by default.
 *
 * The only interaction possible is using left and right mouse buttons to rotate the camera.
 * As we rotate it, we also update the gravity vector of our simulation.
 * Doing so, it gives the impression that the boxes will be always falling toward the bottom of our screen
 * no matter how the camera is rotated.
 *
 * We also register to the physics events to add a visual FXs on two colliding objects.
 * By default the FX is a fast color flash and is, as usual, tweakable in realtime (ie. reloading
 * the config history will apply the new settings immediately as the FX isn't kept in cache by default).
 *
 * Updating an object scale (including changing its scale with FXs) will update its physical properties.
 * Keep in mind that scaling an object with a physical body is more expensive as we have to delete
 * the current shapes and recreate them at the correct size.
 * This is done as our current single physics plugin is based on Box2D which doesn't allow realtime
 * rescaling of shapes.
 *
 * This tutorial does only show basic physics and collision control, but, for example, you can also
 * be notified with events for object separating or keeping contact.
