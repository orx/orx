; Orx settings template / UTF-8 unicode support

; Sections are defined using [ ]
; Example:
; [My section]

; Everything after a ';' is considered as comment

; Key/value pairs are written like this:
; MyKey = MyValue
; Warning! If you want to add comments, use the ';' separator
; Example:
; MyKey = MyValue; Everything I wrote now is part of comments and not of the value

; If you want to use a ';' in a non-numerical value, use a block assignation delimited with '"'
; Example:
; MyKey = "MyValuePart1 ; MyValuePart2"
; Blocks are also useful for assigning multi-line values
; Example:
; MyKey = "This value
; spans
; on multiple lines"

; If you double the first '"', the value won't be considered as a block but as a regular one. It'll still contain a '"' at the start of the string value;
; Example:
; MyKey = ""MyQuotedValue"
; The string <"MyQuotedValue">, including the quotes, will be stored as a value

; All sections can inherit from any other one using the inheritance marker '@'
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey1 = MyValue1;
; MyKey2 = MyValue2;
; [Object@Template] <= This section will contains all values defined in the section 'Template';

; A parent can be removed when overriding a section and using no name after '@'.
; The implicit default parent section can be forced to be ignored by using the specific '@@' syntax
; Example:
; [Object] <= This section doesn't use any explicit parent but will use the implicit default parent if defined (see SettingsTemplate.ini, section [Config])
; [Object@Template] <= This section now uses 'Template' as an explicit parent section;
; [Object@] <= This section now has removed any explicit parent but is still using the implicit default parent if defined (see SettingsTemplate.ini, section [Config]))
; [Object@@] <= This section now has removed any parent and will not use the implicit default parent section either

; All values can be locally inherited from another section using the inheritance marker '@', with the optional use of '.' if we want to specify another key
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey = MyValue;
; MyOtherKey = MyOtherValue;
; [Object]
; MyKey = @Template; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be inherited from the one in the section 'Template', with the same key. This inheritance can be chained;
; My2ndKey = @Template.MyKey; <= The value for 'My2ndKey' will be inherited from the section 'Template' using the key 'MyKey'. This inheritance can also be chained;
; MyLastKey = @.MyKey; <= The value for 'MyLastKey' will be inherited from the current section ('Object') using the key 'MyKey'. This inheritance can also be chained;
; NB: MyOtherKey isn't inherited at all in this case.

; All values can implicitly refer to their own section using the inheritance marker '@' by itself. Its value will be dynamic and carry any inheritance to always result in the name of the child section;
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey = @; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be 'Template', the name of this section
; MyOtherKey = @; <= Same here, the value for 'MyOtherKey' will also be the name of this section: 'Template'
; [Object@Template]
; MyNewKey = @; <= The value for 'MyNewKey' will be 'Object'
; MyKey = @Template; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be inherited from the section 'Template' using the same key and its value will be 'Object', ie. this section, not the parent one, 'Template'
; NB: MyOtherKey will use the section inheritance and its value will be 'Object', ie. this section, not the parent one, 'Template'

; In the case of the in-section/nameless inheritance (@.Key), the "nameless" section used will also be dynamic;
; [Parent]
; MyKey = MyValue
; MyOtherKey = @.MyKey
; [Child@Parent]
; MyKey = MyLastValue
; Querying Child.MyOtherKey will result in 'MyLastValue': Child.MyOtherKey -> Parent.MyOtherKey -> <nameless>.Mykey -> Child.MyKey -> MyLastValue

; If you want to load another file, you need to write this on an empty line:
; @path/to/MyOtherFile@
; Loading will happen instantly in the parsing, which can override previously defined values
; Also, values defined in the "included" file can be overridden afterward
; Lastly, after loading an "included" file, parsing will continue in the same section as before
; Example:
; [MySection]
; Key1 = Var1;
; @IncludeFile@
; Key2 = Var2; <= this will be added to the 'MySection' section

; FLOAT values are expressed with a '.' as decimal separator.
; INT values can be expressed using different prefixes (not case sensitive):
; - decimal without any prefix: 16
; - hexadecimal with prefix '0x': 0x10
; - octal with prefix '0': 020
; - binary with prefix '0b': 0b10000
; VECTOR values are expressed this way:
; MyVector = (1.0, 2.0, 3.0); NB: { } can be used in place of ( ). Components can be (x, y, z) most of the time, or (r, g, b)/(h, s, l)/(h, s, v) for color

; Wherever numerical values are used (Ints, Floats and Vectors), a random generated value can be obtained using the separator ~.
; Example:
; Value1 = 0.5 ~ 1.0;
; Value2 = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ~ (1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

; You can specify lists of values using the separator #.
; The default behavior will be to select randomly a value from a list *EXCEPT* if a list item index is provided in the code.
; For all properties defined in this template, values will be taken randomly if a list is provided for any field that doesn't explicitly accept one.
; Lists can contain random values.
; Example:
; Key1 = Var1 # Var2 # RandVar3 ~ RandVar4 # Var5;
; Lists can span multiple lines when using # at the end of the line (line ending comments are allowed).
; If you want to define an empty element at the end of a list, use ##
; Example:
; Key2 = Var1 # Var2 #
;        Var3 #; This list still continues on next line and this comment is valid.
;        Var4  ; This list is now complete and contains 4 elements.
; Key3 = Var1 # Var2 ##; This list will not span on the next line but will contain a 3rd (and last) empty element.

; You can also append items to properties using the assignment operator '+='. Append values to a property that doesn't exist is a valid behavior:
; in this case a regular value will be created, ie. the '+' is ignored.
; Example:
; Key1  = Item1 # Item2;
; Key1 += Item3;
; Key2 += NewItem1 # NewItem2;
; Key1 now contains 3 items: Item1, Item2 and Item3. Key2 only contains 2 items: NewItem1 and NewItem2.

AutoReset = [Bool]; NB: If true, spawner will auto reset when emptied;
UseAlpha = [Bool]; NB: Will only work if the spawner is linked to a parent object, from which it'll take the alpha;
UseColor = [Bool]; NB: Will only work if the spawner is linked to a parent object, from which it'll take the color;
UseRotation = [Bool]; NB: If true, spawner's rotation will be transmitted to the spawned object. Defaults to true;
UseScale = [Bool]; NB: If true, spawner's scale will be transmitted to the spawned object. Defaults to true;
WaveSize = Int; NB: Number of object to spawn in every wave. 0 or no value means no automated wave spawning. This can be a randomized value;
WaveDelay = Float; NB: elapsed time between two spawned waves, in seconds. 0 means all the objects spawned at once. This can be a randomized value;
Immediate = [Bool]; NB: If set, the delay will be ignored for the first wave after creation or reset; Defaults to false;
ObjectSpeed = [Vector]; NB: If specified, this speed will be applied to spawned object. This can be a randomized value;
UseRelativeSpeed = [Bool]; NB: If true, the speed will be applied relatively to the current rotation & scale of the spawner. Defaults to false;
UseSelfAsParent = [Bool]; NB: If set to true, the created object's parent will be the spawner, and will be always relative to the spawner's position, scale and rotation. Defaults to false;
CleanOnDelete = [Bool]; NB: If set to true, all the live spawned objects will be deleted when the spawner gets deleted. Defaults to false;
IgnoreFromParent = none|all|rotation|scale|position|position.rotation|position.scale|position.position; NB: Defines which parts of the parent's transformation will be ignored when transmitted to the spawner. Defaults to none;

[ShaderTemplate]
Code = "Your shader code block" ; NB: Used to declare a monolithic shader; Will be ignored if CodeList is defined;
CodeList = CodeKey1 # ... # CodeKeyN ; NB: The values of this list will be used as config keys from this section to reconstruct, in the given order, a multi-part shader; If not defined, Code will be used instead;
ParamList = ParamFloat # ParamTexture # ParamVector # ...; NB: Define all the parameters your shader code needs. Defined params then must have a default value to guess their type. If none is provided, type defaults to texture and will use shader's owner texture as value;
ParamFloat = [Float]|time; NB: If a list is explicitly defined here, orx will create an array of floats of the same size as shader parameter; Use 'time' to get the 'active time' of the owner (works with objects only and will force UseCustomParam to true).
ParamVector = [Vector]; NB: If a list is explicitly defined here, orx will create an array of vectors of the same size as shader parameter;
ParamTexture = path/to/texture; NB: If an invalid path is given, or nothing is specified, the owner's texture will be used by default. If a list is explicitly defined here, orx will create an array of textures of the same size as shader parameter;
UseCustomParam = [Bool]; NB: When set to true, an event will be sent to override params values at runtime as well as the automated "time" value. Defaults to false, ie. no runtime override unless "time" is used for a float param;
KeepInCache = [Bool]; NB: If true, the shader will always stay in cache, even if no shader of this type is currently in use. Can save time but costs memory. Defaults to false;

[TimeLineTrackTemplate]
FloatValue = "Your timeline event text here" | "Your command"; NB: FloatValue is a time in second (>= 0) after which this timeline event is going to be triggered; If the event is a valid command it'll get executed by the command module;
Loop = [Bool];
Immediate = [Bool]; NB: If true, track will be executed immediately after being added to a timeline as opposed to during the next object update. Defaults to false;
KeepInCache = [Bool]; NB: If true, the timeline track will always stay in cache, even if no track of this type is currently in use. Can save time but costs memory. Defaults to false;
