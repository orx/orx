; Orx settings template / UTF-8 unicode support

; Sections are defined using [ ]
; Example:
; [My section]

; Everything after a ';' is considered as comment

; Key/value pairs are written like this:
; MyKey = MyValue
; Warning! If you want to add comments, use the ';' separator
; Example:
; MyKey = MyValue; Everything I wrote now is part of comments and not of the value

; If you want to use a ';' in a non-numerical value, use a block assignation delimited with '"'
; Example:
; MyKey = "MyValuePart1 ; MyValuePart2"
; Blocks are also useful for assigning multi-line values
; Example:
; MyKey = "This value
; spans
; on multiple lines"

; If you double the first '"', the value won't be considered as a block but as a regular one. It'll still contain a '"' at the start of the string value;
; Example:
; MyKey = ""MyQuotedValue"
; The string <"MyQuotedValue">, including the quotes, will be stored as a value

; All sections can inherit from any other one using the inheritance marker '@'
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey1 = MyValue1;
; MyKey2 = MyValue2;
; [Object@Template] <= This section will contains all values defined in the section 'Template';

; A parent can be removed when overriding a section and using no name after '@'.
; The implicit default parent section can be forced to be ignored by using the specific '@@' syntax
; Example:
; [Object] <= This section doesn't use any explicit parent but will use the implicit default parent if defined (see SettingsTemplate.ini, section [Config])
; [Object@Template] <= This section now uses 'Template' as an explicit parent section;
; [Object@] <= This section now has removed any explicit parent but is still using the implicit default parent if defined (see SettingsTemplate.ini, section [Config]))
; [Object@@] <= This section now has removed any parent and will not use the implicit default parent section either

; All values can be locally inherited from another section using the inheritance marker '@', with the optional use of '.' if we want to specify another key
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey = MyValue;
; MyOtherKey = MyOtherValue;
; [Object]
; MyKey = @Template; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be inherited from the one in the section 'Template', with the same key. This inheritance can be chained;
; My2ndKey = @Template.MyKey; <= The value for 'My2ndKey' will be inherited from the section 'Template' using the key 'MyKey'. This inheritance can also be chained;
; MyLastKey = @.MyKey; <= The value for 'MyLastKey' will be inherited from the current section ('Object') using the key 'MyKey'. This inheritance can also be chained;
; NB: MyOtherKey isn't inherited at all in this case.

; All values can implicitly refer to their own section using the inheritance marker '@' by itself. Its value will be dynamic and carry any inheritance to always result in the name of the child section;
; Example:
; [Template]
; MyKey = @; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be 'Template', the name of this section
; MyOtherKey = @; <= Same here, the value for 'MyOtherKey' will also be the name of this section: 'Template'
; [Object@Template]
; MyNewKey = @; <= The value for 'MyNewKey' will be 'Object'
; MyKey = @Template; <= The value for 'MyKey' will be inherited from the section 'Template' using the same key and its value will be 'Object', ie. this section, not the parent one, 'Template'
; NB: MyOtherKey will use the section inheritance and its value will be 'Object', ie. this section, not the parent one, 'Template'

; In the case of the in-section/nameless inheritance (@.Key), the "nameless" section used will also be dynamic;
; [Parent]
; MyKey = MyValue
; MyOtherKey = @.MyKey
; [Child@Parent]
; MyKey = MyLastValue
; Querying Child.MyOtherKey will result in 'MyLastValue': Child.MyOtherKey -> Parent.MyOtherKey -> <nameless>.Mykey -> Child.MyKey -> MyLastValue

; When a newly defined section had some previous content, the default behavior is to extend/override what is already present.
; If we'd rather clean all previous content of that section instead of extending/overriding it, we can add a '!' in front of the section definition.
; Example:
; [FirstSection]
; Key1 = 1
; [SecondSection]
; Key2 = 2
; [FirstSection] ; <= Here we're keeping what is already in this section
; NewKey1 = 3
; ![SecondSection] ; <= Here all the previous content of this section gets wiped
; NewKey2 = 4
; 2 values are present in FirstSection (Key1 = 1 and NewKey1 = 3) whereas only one value is present in SecondSection (NewKey2 = 4)

; If you want to load another file, you need to write this on an empty line:
; @path/to/MyOtherFile@
; Loading will happen instantly in the parsing, which can override previously defined values
; Also, values defined in the "included" file can be overridden afterward
; Lastly, after loading an "included" file, parsing will continue in the same section as before
; Example:
; [MySection]
; Key1 = Var1;
; @IncludeFile@
; Key2 = Var2; <= this will be added to the 'MySection' section

; FLOAT values are expressed with a '.' as decimal separator.
; INT values can be expressed using different prefixes (not case sensitive):
; - decimal without any prefix: 16
; - hexadecimal with prefix '0x': 0x10
; - octal with prefix '0': 020
; - binary with prefix '0b': 0b10000
; VECTOR values are expressed this way:
; MyVector = (1.0, 2.0, 3.0); NB: { } can be used in place of ( ). Components can be (x, y, z) most of the time, or (r, g, b)/(h, s, l)/(h, s, v) for color
; When the last component of a vector is not specified, 0 will be used for it.
; Example:
; MyOtherVector = (4, 5); This is equivalent to MyOtherVector = (4, 5, 0)

; Wherever numerical values are used (Ints, Floats and Vectors), a random generated value can be obtained using the separator ~.
; Example:
; Value1 = 0.5 ~ 1.0;
; Value2 = (0.0, 0.0, 0.0) ~ (1.0, 1.0, 1.0);
; Random values can be constrained to steps/increments using the syntax v1 ~step~ v2.
; Example:
; Value3 = 0 ~2~ 10; This will produce an even value between 0 and 10 (ie. step = 2).
; Note that if the value is retrieved as a float, the upper bound cannot be reached, however it can be reached for all integer types.

; When using vector values, one can set a component to 0 to get an unconstrained value for that component.
; Example:
; MyRandomVector = (1, 3, 5) ~(0, 0.1)~ (2, 4, 6); X will be unconstrained between 1 and 2 (step = 0), Y will be between 3 and 4 with a step of 0.1 and Z will be unconstrained between 5 and 6 (no Z component -> Z = 0).

; You can specify lists of values using the separator #.
; The default behavior will be to select randomly a value from a list *EXCEPT* if a list item index is provided in the code.
; For all properties defined in this template, values will be taken randomly if a list is provided for any field that doesn't explicitly accept one.
; Lists can contain random values.
; Example:
; Key1 = Var1 # Var2 # RandVar3 ~ RandVar4 # Var5;
; Lists can span multiple lines when using # at the end of the line (line ending comments are allowed).
; If you want to define an empty element at the end of a list, use ##
; Example:
; Key2 = Var1 # Var2 #
;        Var3 #; This list still continues on next line and this comment is valid.
;        Var4  ; This list is now complete and contains 4 elements.
; Key3 = Var1 # Var2 ##; This list will not span on the next line but will contain a 3rd (and last) empty element.

; You can also append items to properties using the assignment operator '+='. Append values to a property that doesn't exist is a valid behavior:
; in this case a regular value will be created, ie. the '+' is ignored.
; Example:
; Key1  = Item1 # Item2;
; Key1 += Item3;
; Key2 += NewItem1 # NewItem2;
; Key1 now contains 3 items: Item1, Item2 and Item3. Key2 only contains 2 items: NewItem1 and NewItem2.

; Commands can be used in order to get more dynamic contents, they'll be prefixed by `%`.
; A sequence of multiple commands can be expressed by separating them with `,`.
; There are two ways to define embedded commands:
; - Commands evaluated at load time, not tied to any specific property. These will be evaluated once, when the file is loaded. Example:
;   % > Get OtherSection BaseValue, + < 1, Set NewSection ValuePlusOne <
; - Commands that are lazily evaluated every time the value of a property is retrieved. Example:
;   Key = % MyOwnCommand 42
; In this second case, when more than a single command is defined, the property's value will be the result returned by the last one.
; Example:
; MyOtherKey = % log "Fetching dynamic content of MyOtherKey", * 21 2; Fetching MyOtherKey will return 42
; Lazy commands can also be embedded inside lists.
; Example:
; Key = 1 # % + 2 3 # 10; Fetching Key will return either 1, 5 or 10
