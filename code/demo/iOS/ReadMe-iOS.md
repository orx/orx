HowTo
-----

If you're not familiar with orx you can start by opening the XCode project in `/dev-ios/build/ios/xcode`.  
This project contains both orx library and a small iOS-oriented demo.

The demo uses iOS's accelerometer (using orx's joystick module) and iOS's touch system (using orx's mouse module).

Demo's code is found in /dev-ios/demo/iOS/orxTest.mm and is very short.  
Demo's config files can be found in `/dev-ios/demo/iOS/config`.

Fiddling with both demo's code and config is probably a good place to start understanding how orx works.  
[The wiki](https://orx-project.org/wiki) also contains useful information as well as some more generic tutorials.

When starting your own new project, you can either modify the demo project file (that also compiles orx) or use
the precompiled libraries found in `liborx-fat-sdk9.2.zip` along with the include files found in `/dev-ios/include`.

The precompiled libraries contain both device & simulator code for more convenience.
