Intro
-----

Orx is a 2D-oriented, data-driven, portable game engine focused primarily on ease of use and powerful features.
See below for a list of supported platforms.

This is the first release candidate for orx v1.4. If you find any bugs,
please report them at http://forum.orx-project.org, on the "Bug report - Feature request" board,
or via orx's issue page/tracker at https://bitbucket.org/orx/orx/issues?status=new&status=open

The current features of orx engine are:
- hardware-accelerated rendering that provides: translation, anisotropic scale, rotation,
  transparency (alpha blending), different blending modes, coloring, tiling and mirroring
- powerful config system that makes orx data-driven and provides an easy to use load/save system
- timelines and commands modules allow for config-driven scripting-like features
- interactive console can execute commands at runtime (very useful for tweaking/debug purposes)
- animation engine (including a chaining graph & custom animation events for synchronization)
- fragment (pixel) shader support
- visual FXs based on curve combinations
- integrated runtime profiler (with graphical display) to easily spot which parts of your game needs to be optimized
- collision handling and rigid body physics
- camera/viewport scheme allowing multiple views displayed with camera translation, zoom and rotation
- generic input system that abstracts keyboard, mouse, joystick, touch and accelerometer inputs
- powerful localization module
- spawners (provides an easy way to create particles or projectiles)
- 3D positioning using "scene nodes"
- custom bitmap font support
- automatic differential scrolling and depth scaling upon request
- music and spatialized sound support
- clock system that provides time consistency and allows time stretching + high precision timers
- event manager
- unicode support with UTF-8 encoding
- plugin system
- screenshot capture tool (supports bmp, png, jpg, tga and dds)

See doc/html directory for the doxygen documentation of orx's API.

You can find details about the tutorials (as well as community-made ones), the tools and the data-driven side of orx
(ie. how to use the config system) on orx's wiki at: http://wiki.orx-project.org

The English version is the most complete one.
Chinese and Spanish translations are entirely written and maintained by community members, and they might be less accurate/somewhat outdated.


Supported Platforms
-------------------

The engine compiles and is tested for:
- Linux (x86/x86-64 with codelite, codeblocks and GNU makefile)
- Windows (x86 with vs2008, vs2010 and mingw32 with codelite, codeblocks and GNU makefile)
- MacOS X (x86/x86_64/ppc/ppc64 with xcode or x86/x86_64 with codelite, codeblocks and GNU makefile), version 10.5+ for GLFW plugins (default version) and 10.4+ for SFML ones (no joystick support).
- iOS (iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad, simulator & device with xcode, codelite, codeblocks and makefile)
- Android (NDK build files, no simulator support)


Versions
--------

Those are not revision versions but link/run versions.
Orx library can be compiled as a static or a dynamic library.
In addition to these modes, orx can be compiled as an embedded version or not.

Orx's core is basically platform-independent. All the platform/OS-dependent features
are implemented via plugins. These plugins can be loaded at runtime (hotplug) or
they can be embedded at linktime.

If you use the non-embedded versions, you'll have to specify which plugins to use.
This is more flexible but also requires additional files (the plugins themselves).
The embedded version will store everything in orx's library, meaning you won't be able
to choose which plugin to use at runtime, but will also be more compact. This will
also make orx run considerably faster.

From the download page you'll find precompiled binaries for Windows (x86), Linux (x86/x86_64), MacOS X (ppc/x86/x86_64),
iOS and Android, using the dynamic embedded versions only.
If you want to use the non-embedded versions (to use with your own plugins)
or the static ones, you'll need to compile orx yourself from the source.
Everything compiles out-of-the-box for the hardware platforms cited above.

The embedded versions currently use:
- GLFW-based (+SOIL) plugins for display, joystick, keyboard and mouse for all non-iOS/non-Android platforms
- OpenAL-based (+libsndfile/stb_vorbis) plugins for sound for all non-Android platforms
- Box2D-based plugin for physics
- homemade plugin for 2D rendering

- OpenGL ES/OpenAL-based plugins for display and sound on iOS
- OpenGL ES-based plugin for display on Android
- NDK-based plugin for sound on Android
- Touch/MultiTouch-based plugin for mouse on iOS and Android
- Accelerometer-based plugin for joystick on iOS and Android

All the 11 basic and advanced official tutorials are shipped with the dev packages, including precompiled release binaries.

Some tools (precompiled binaries only) are also shipped with the dev packages:
  . orxCrypt  : command line tool to encrypt/decrypt/merge multiple config files
  . orxFontGen: command line tool (based on FreeType2) to generate custom bitmap fonts (.tga texture & .ini config file) from TrueType fonts


Packages
--------

You can download all the packages from sourceforge (http://orx.sf.net) or bitbucket (https://bitbucket.orx/orx/orx).
Here is a list with a small description for each package.

- orx-doc-1.4rc0.zip: orx's API doxygen documentation + PDF version of the English wiki (detailed tutorials and config system)

- orx-src-1.4rc0.zip: orx's source code including build projects for
  . codelite (Windows and Linux, all versions, Mac OS X, non-static versions)
  . codeblocks (Windows and Linux, all versions, Mac OS X, non-static versions)
  . GNU makefiles (Windows and Linux, all versions, Mac OS X, non-static versions)
  . vs2008 & vs2010 (Windows Visual Studio, all versions)
  . xcode (3.2+, for MacOS X, non-static versions; 4.2 for iOS, static embedded versions)
  . ndk build files for Android (static embedded versions)
NB: You'll need orx-extern-1.4rc0.zip (orx plugins' external dependencies) if you intend to compile orx yourself.

- orx-extern-1.4rc0.zip: orx's external dependencies. You will only *NEED* these if you
use orx-src-1.4rx0.zip and you plan on compiling orx yourself. They are not needed otherwise.
The external libraries are usually modified versions of the original ones.
VERY IMPORTANT: If you want to compile orx yourself, you'll need these versions and not the official ones.

Compiling
---------

The easiest way to learn how to compile your project using orx for a given platform
is to look at the tutorial build project files. If you want to use another version
(tutorials use the dynamic embedded versions of orx), please look at
orx's launcher (main executable) build project file from the src package.

The debug version is far slower than the release one, but will output all the warning
and error messages useful for debugging.

Here's a quick list of the available compile preprocessor flags:
- __orxDEBUG__    : used to compile and link against the debug versions of orx library
                    (liborxd.a / orxd.lib / liborxd.dylib), if not specified it refers to
                    the release versions (liborx.a / orx.lib / liborx.dylib).
                    NB: If you want to link against the debug versions of orx library, you need
                    to specify it to your compiler!

- __orxPROFILER__ : used to enable the profiling push/pop macros for release builds
                    It's automatically enabled for debug builds and it has been enabled to
                    build liborxp.a / orxp.lib / orxp.dll / liborxp.dylib / liborxp.so
                    NB: You can define it in your projects even when using regular release builds,
                    but you won't be able to see orx's internal profiling markers!

- __orxSTATIC__   : used to compile and link against the static versions of orx library.
                    NB: If you want to link against the static versions of orx library, you need
                    to specify it to your compiler!

- __orxEMBEDDED__ : used to compile the embedded versions of orx library.
                    NB: this flag is *ONLY* needed when compiling orx library, not when linking
                    against it.


There are other preprocessor flags used when compiling the orx library,
but those should be easy enough to decipher.
However, you might want to specify them manually for cross-compiling or
use them so that your code will behave differently depending on the architecture
for which you're compiling. Here's a quick list of these flags:
- __orxARM__          : orx is being compiled for an ARM architecture
- __orxPPC__          : orx is being compiled for a PowerPC architecture
- __orxPPC64__        : orx is being compiled for a PowerPC 64 architecture
- __orxX86__          : orx is being compiled for a x86 architecture
- __orxX86_64__       : orx is being compiled for a x86-64 architecture
- __orxLITTLE_ENDIAN  : orx is being compiled for a little endian architecture
- __orxBIG_ENDIAN     : orx is being compiled for a big endian architecture
- __orxGCC__          : orx is being compiled with gcc
- __orxMSVC__         : orx is being compiled with visual studio C/C++
- __orxLLVM__         : orx is being compiled with llvm/clang
- __orxWINDOWS__      : orx is being compiled for Windows (x86)
- __orxMAC__          : orx is being compiled for MacOS X (ppc/x86/x86_64)
- __orxLINUX__        : orx is being compiled for Linux (x86/x86_64)
- __orxIOS__          : orx is being compiled for iOS
- __orxANDROID__      : orx is being compiled for Android
- __orxANDROID_NATIVE_: orx is being compiled for Android native (2.3+)
- __orxRASPBERRY_PI_  : orx is being compiled for Raspberry Pi
- __orxCPP__          : orx is being compiled with a C++ compiler
- __orxOBJC__         : orx is being compiled with an Objective-C compiler
